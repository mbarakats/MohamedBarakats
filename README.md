### Hi there :wave: :sparkles: 

I am the owner of this hilarious account, Yes, this what I do in life, nothing more! :shipit:

I am a Software Engineer, I work and live in Berlin.

- I use rails to break down stuff, but I use ruby to fix it.

- This is my Linkedin, I am not an active writer there <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohamedbarakats/">But they say that itâ€™s professional to have one</a> :man:

For more information about me (only me, who can tell that), feel free to contact :heart: :eagle:
